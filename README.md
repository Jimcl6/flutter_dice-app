# dice_app

An Dice Roller Project by App Brewery, that I improvised on.

## Getting Started

This project teaches about how we can build Flutter apps using the State and Stateful Widget.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
